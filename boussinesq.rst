Formulations and Numerical Schemes
**********************************

A complete set of fully nonlinear Boussinesq equations and derivations of the conservation form of theoretical equations can be found in `Shi et al. (2012) <http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1463500311002010>`_. 

Formulations in the spherical cooridinates can be found in `Kirby et al. (2013) <http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1463500312001692>`_.
