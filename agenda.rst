**Training Session Topics**
   
**TUESDAY:** Training Session #1 (Hands-on afternoon sessions) [Lead: Matt Malej]
 * FUNWAVE-TVD and Parallel Computing (MPI) - Documentation Wiki 
 * Latest version (3.1) - current capabilities and those in development 
 * Where do I get the code? - Version Control (Github)
 * Sandbox for USACE and DoD member with GUI
 * How to build (compile/link) and install FUNWAVE-TVD on different machines for parallel computation?
 
**TUESDAY:** Training Session #2 [Lead: Matt Malej]
 * How to run FUNWAVE-TVD? Navigating the basic sections within the INPUT file for different simulations (numerics, physics, input, output, etc.).
 * Setting up (Linux/Mac OS X and HPC machines with PBS scheduler), running, and post-processing your first FUNWAVE-TVD simulation (1D beach runup or levee overtopping with shoaling and wetting/drying).
 * PROGRESSION (for those participants needed additional challenge) - use the levee bathymetry to simulate a regular monochromatic wave overtopping the levee
 
 
**WEDNESDAY:** Training Session #3 [Lead: Fengyan Shi, Assist: Matt Malej]
 * 2D plane beach case with various wave conditions (different wavemakers)
  
   1)monochromatic waves 

   2)Irregular waves
 * PROGRESSION (for those participants needed additional challenge) - Analysis of wave-averaged properties. 
 
 
**WEDNESDAY:** Training Session #4 [Lead: Fengyan Shi, Assist: Matt Malej]
 * Wave simulation on 2D random bathymetry with complex shoreline geometries
  
   1)Inlet problem (to include post-processing analysis of Harbor Resonance)

   2)Obstacles and Breakwaters (partially absorbing and reflecting inner boundaries) 
 * PROGRESSION (for those participants needed additional challenge) - Set up your own surface wave case
 
**THURSDAY:** Training Session #5 [Lead: Fengyan Shi, Assist: Matt Malej]
 * Ship-wakes

   1)Setup with multiple vessels (paths, size, velocities)

   2)A vessel moving on random bathymetry 
 
 * PROGRESSION (for those participants needed additional challenge) - Try the case of the circular island and set up a different path. 
 
**THURSDAY:** Training Session #6 [Lead: Fatima Nemati, Assist: Fengyan Shi]
 * Tsunami simulation
 * Tsunami simulation using the spherical coordinates
 * Tsunami sources
