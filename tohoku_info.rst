Basic info

 Computational domain covers a region of the Pacific Ocean from 60째S to 60째N in the south-north direction, and from 132째E to 68째W in the west-east direction. The example is a 30min x 30min resolution case. The 2-min resolution result can be found in Kirby et al. (2013). 

 Dimensions 320 X 240

 DX = DY = 0.5 deg

 Tsunami source: the tsunami source is constructed in Grilli et al. (2012), which is based on the 3D FEM model of Masterlark (2003), denoted UA source. The non-hydrostatic model NHWAVE (Ma et al., 2012) is used to simulate the first 5 min of tsunami generation, as in Grilli et al. (2012), using a smaller and finer local 1 km resolution Cartesian grid, based on the UA source. The NHWAVE results of u, v eta are used as the initial conditions for FUNWAVE-TVD.
