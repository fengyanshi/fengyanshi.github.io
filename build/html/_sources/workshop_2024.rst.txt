Workshop 2024
==============

We are pleased to announce that the sixth FUNWAVE-TVD Training Workshop will be held on July 23-25, 2024, at the University of Delaware, Newark, DE.  This workshop is organized by the Center for Applied Coastal Research (CACR), University of Delaware, and the US Army Engineer Research and Development Center (ERDC). The workshop is open to all FUNWAVE users and interested parties.

This workshop will cover general topics, including the modeling of nearshore surface waves and processes such as harbor resonance, nearshore wave transformation, refraction and diffraction with complex geometries, non-coherent internal wavemaker, nearshore circulation, and tsunami propagation and inundation from ocean basin- to nearshore-scales. It will also introduce some new features added to the model recently, such as varying water level boundary condition in a tide/surge module, sub-gridding, and bubble/foam. The three-day workshop will include hands-on training sessions for new users, as well as technical talks from the community of practice and experienced users.

Registration and participation in the workshop is *free*. Please be advised that breakfast and lunch *will not* be provided. There are several lunch options through the UDel campus within walking distance. A list of recommended lunch options will be provided at the workshop.
