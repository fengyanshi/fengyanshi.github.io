Slope Limiting Methodology
**************************

Slope limiting methodology is a useful avalanching algorithm to control the maximum bottom slope for modeling sea
bed and shoreline evolution. By definition, the bottom slope cannot exceed the repose angle of the sediment. Avalanching occurs to reform a bed with the maximum slope equal to the sediment repose angle. The repose angle is dependent on the sand grain properties (usually, between 30 deg to 40 deg, `Splinter et al., 2011 <https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1029/2010JC006382>`_) and can be given to the model as an input value.
