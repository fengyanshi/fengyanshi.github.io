**Where to start?**
==========================
This comprehensive Wiki provides general introductions to all model components and theory behind the numerical formulations in FUNWAVE-TVD. Simple examples and tutorials are presented for beginners, as well as download and installation instructions to begin using FUNWAVE--TVD locally. The detailed model equations and numerical schemes can be found in `Shi et al. (2012) <http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1463500311002010>`_.

If you are new to FUNWAVE, we recommend first reviewing the coastal processes the model is capable of resolving (below), and the physics of how these processes are solved in the model. The theory behind each module can be found on the :ref:`Basics <section-basics>` page. Next, download and setup instructions can be found on the :ref:`Model Download and Setup <section-download>` page, where we list the prerequisites needed to begin running FUNWAVE locally and describe how to build your "Makefile". In addition, take the time to review the input parameters for each module on the :ref:`Definitions of Parameters <section-definitions>` page. To begin running simple cases, review the example scenarios listed on the :ref:`Examples <section-examples>` page and refer to the :ref:`subsection-checklist` as needed. If you run into any issues with model setup and execution, submit your questions to the FUNWAVE community by subscribing to the mailing group.
