**Training Session Topics**

WEDNESDAY: Training Session #1 (Hands-on afternoon sessions) [Lead: Matt Malej]
 * FUNWAVE-TVD and Parallel Computing (MPI) - Documentation Wiki
 * Latest version (4.0) - current capabilities and those in development
 * Where do I get the code? - Version Control (Github)
 * Sandbox for USACE and DoD member with GUI
 * How to build (compile/link) and install FUNWAVE-TVD on different machines for parallel computation?

WEDNESDAY: Training Session #2 [Lead: Matt Malej]
 * How to run FUNWAVE-TVD? Navigating the basic sections within the INPUT file for different simulations (numerics, physics, input, output, etc.).
 * Setting up (Linux/Mac OS X and HPC machines with PBS scheduler), running, and post-processing your first FUNWAVE-TVD simulation (1D beach runup or levee overtopping with shoaling and wetting/drying).
 * 2D case: Waves on 2D plane beach
 * PROGRESSION (for those participants needed additional challenge) - use the levee bathymetry to simulate a regular monochromatic wave overtopping the levee

THURSDAY: Training Session #3 [Lead: Fengyan Shi]
 * Waves and wave-induced circulation and sediment transport  
 
   * Rip channels  
   * PROGRESSION (for those participants needed additional challenge) - Analysis of wave-averaged properties.
 
THURSDAY: Training Session #4 [Lead: Fengyan Shi]
 * Wave simulation on 2D random bathymetry with complex shoreline geometries

   * Inlet problem (to include post-processing analysis of Harbor Resonance)
   * Obstacles and Breakwaters (partially absorbing and reflecting inner boundaries)
 * PROGRESSION (for those participants needed additional challenge) - Set up your own surface wave case

FRIDAY: Training Session #5 [Lead: Matt Malej]

 * Ship-wakes

   * Setup with multiple vessels (paths, size, velocities)
   * Shipwake-induced sediment transport
   * A vessel moving on random bathymetry

 * PROGRESSION (for those participants needed additional challenge) - Try the case of the circular island and set up a different path.

FRIDAY: Training Session #6 [Lead: Fengyan Shi] 
 * Tsunami sources
 * Tsunami simulation using the sperical coordinates
