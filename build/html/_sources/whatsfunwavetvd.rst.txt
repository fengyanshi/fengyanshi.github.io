What is FUNWAVE--TVD
*************************
FUNWAVE--TVD is the TVD version of the fully nonlinear Boussinesq wave model (FUNWAVE) initially developed by Kirby et al. (1998). The development of the present version was motivated by recent needs for modeling of  surfzone--scale optical properties in a Boussinesq model framework,  and  modeling of  Tsunami wave in both a regional/coastal scale for prediction of coastal inundation and a basin scale for wave propagation.  This version  features  several theoretical and numerical improvements, including 1) a more complete set of fully nonlinear Boussinesq equations; 2) MUSCL--TVD solver with adaptive Runge--Kutta time stepping; 3) Shock--capturing wave breaking scheme; 4) wetting--drying moving boundary condition with incorporation of HLL construction method into the scheme; 5) an option for parallel computation.  
The documentation provides derivations of the conservation form of theoretical equations, re--arrangement of pressure gradient term in order to obtain a numerically well--balanced form, detailed numerical schemes, users' manual and examples.
