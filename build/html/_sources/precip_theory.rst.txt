To simulate rainfall effects, especially in modeling compound flooding, the percipitation rate is added in the mass conservation equation

.. math:: {\bf M}_t + \nabla \cdot \left( \frac{{\bf MM}}{H} \right) + \nabla \left(\frac{1}{2}g(\eta^2 + 2h\eta) \right) = R_p  

where :math:`R_p` represents the precipitation rate. The unit for :math:`R_p` is mm/hour. It is converted to m/s in the equation.
