We are pleased to announce that FUNWAVE-TVD Workshop 2019 will be held at Hohai University, Nanjing, China, from **18--20 Oct 2019**. This workshop will be a joint effort of the Hohai University and the University of Delaware.

The three-day workshop will include invited talks, technical presentations from community of practicing and experienced users, as well as  hands-on training sessions for new users.   It covers general topics, such as the modeling of nearshore surface waves and processes such as harbor resonance, nearshore wave transformation, refraction and diffraction with complex geometries, nearshore circulation, and tsunami propagation and inundation from ocean basin- to nearshore-scales. It will also include the new features added to the model recently, such as ship-wake generation, sediment transport, and model coupling and nesting framework. 

More details will follow shortly regarding registration and accommodations. Information about FUNWAVE-TVD can be found at https://fengyanshi.github.io/build/html/index.html

Any questions can be directed to Fengyan Shi at fyshi@udel.edu, (302) 831 2449, or Jian Shi at jianshi@hhu.edu.cn.  

NOTE: the registration will be capped at 50 participants.
