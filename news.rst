FUNWAVE-TVD Training Workshop will be held at the University of Delaware, Newark, DE from **25-27 July 2017**. This workshop is organized by the Center for Applied Coastal Research (CACR), University of Delaware and the US Army Engineer Research and Development Center (ERDC). The workshop is open to all FUNWAVE users and interested parties. 

The three-day workshop will include training sessions for new users, as well as technical talks from community of practicing and experienced users. Topics will cover the modeling of nearshore surface waves and processes such as harbor resonance, nearshore wave transformation, refraction and diffraction with complex geometries, nearshore circulation, wave interaction with reefs and vegetation, and tsunami propagation and inundation from ocean basin-to nearshore scales. Several new features, such as modeling of ship wave generation and the corresponding effects on adjacent shorelines, meteotsunami simulation, as well as ongoing coupling work with NHWAVE will also be introduced during the workshop. 

NOTE: the workshop will not have a registration fee.
