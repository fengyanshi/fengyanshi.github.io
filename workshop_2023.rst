Workshop 2023
=======================
We are pleased to share the information about the Fifth FUNWAVE-TVD Training Workshop held on July 25-27, 2023, at the Northeastern University, Boston, MA.  This workshop was organized by the Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, Northeastern University, the Center for Applied Coastal Research (CACR), University of Delaware, and the US Army Engineer Research and Development Center (ERDC). The workshop is open to all FUNWAVE users and interested parties.

This workshop covers general topics, including the modeling of nearshore surface waves and processes such as harbor resonance, nearshore wave transformation, refraction and diffraction with complex geometries, non-coherent internal wavemaker, nearshore circulation, and tsunami propagation and inundation from ocean basin- to nearshore-scales. It also introduces some new features added to the model recently, such as ship-wake generation, sediment transport, and multi-grid, two-way nesting module. The three-day workshop includes hands-on training sessions for new users, as well as technical talks from the community of practicing and experienced users.
