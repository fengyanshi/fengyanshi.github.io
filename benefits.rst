*******************************************
Benefits of transitioning to the HPC Portal
*******************************************

* Represents a completely new model delivery approach! **Paradigm shift** – from *local* to *“cloud”*
* *Centralized* ERDC Hydro Toolkit with *guidance on what to use and when* (model wise)
* DoD enterprise security credentials/login verifying (CAC) managed externally 
* No concern over versioning or software-system compatibility issues (SMS & Windows)
* Common branding and in-line with Numerical Model Modernization Strategy
* Access *via a browser without ANY local software installation* (ACE-IT network) issues
* **ALL** computations done on the back end! Nothing on your desktop/laptop

* Simulations on *100’s and 1000’s of processors* – fully parallelized on HPC machines
* Most of the *result postprocessing and visualization done on the back end* without the need to move Gigs of data to and from the HPC (no CorpsNet bandwidth restriction)
* *Collaborative* user-friendly GUI computational environment with access to experts
* Direct and fast link to more information (basic + extensive Wiki) without searching any printed of electronic manual/publication
* Parameter bound and input safety checking – reduces number of initial failures
* Larger USACE/DoD user base because of a *reduced* learning curve

.. note::
   The HPC Portal is accessible only to employees of USACE and the greater DoD.
