Ship Propeller Effects on Sediment Transport
************************************************

The effects of ship propeller-induced jet flow on sediment transport were presented by Colangeli et al. (2023). 

Efflux velocity
------------------

The efflux velocity generated by a propeller was estimated by the emperical formula (XXX)

.. math:: U_p = V_0 \exp \left( -2 \frac{y^{\prime 2} + h_p^2}{D_p^2} \right) \mbox{  in ZFE: } x^\prime \le \frac{D_p}{2c}
