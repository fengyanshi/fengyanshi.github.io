Meteo Module
************

The METEO module was initially developed for simulations of meteotsnamis. It now includes subroutines for simulating the wind effects on waves, storm surges, landslide-generated tsunamis and processes related to atmospheric pressure effects. 

====================
Wind effect on waves
====================

Wind effects are modeled using the wind stress forcing proposed by `Chen et al. (2004) <https://doi.org/10.1061/(ASCE)0733-950X(2004)130:6(312>`_. The wind stress is expressed by:

.. math:: {\bf R}_w = \frac{\rho_a}{\rho} C_{dw} |{\bf U}_{10} - {\bf C}| ({\bf U}_{10} - {\bf C})
     :label: wind-effects

where :math:`\rho_a` and :math:`\rho` represent air density and water density, respectively, and :math:`\bf C` is wave celerity. The wind stress is only applied on wave crests. A free parameter representing the ratio of the forced crest height to maximum surface elevation is implemented in the model. 

=============
Holland model
=============

The Holland model is an analytic model of wind and sea level pressure profiles of hurricanes (see `Holland, 1980 <https://journals.ametsoc.org/doi/abs/10.1175/1520-0493(1980)108%3C1212:AAMOTW%3E2.0.CO;2>`_ for more information). The pressure distribution can be expressed by: 

.. math:: p = p_c + (p_n-p_c) exp(-A/r^B)

where :math:`p` is the pressure at radius :math:`r`, :math:`p_c` and :math:`p_n` are the central pressure and the ambient pressure, respectively, and :math:`A` and :math:`B` are scaling parameters from the model input. The velocity distribution can be described by:

.. math:: V_c = [AB(p_n-p_c)exp(-A/r^B)/\rho_a r^B]^{1/2}

Based on the formulations above, it is easy to obtain the following storm parameters:

*The radius of maximum winds (RMW):*

.. math::  R_w = A^{1/B}

*The maximum wind speed:*

.. math:: V_m = C(p_n-p_c)^{1/2}

where:

.. math:: C = (B/\rho_a e)^{1/2}

===========
Storm surge
===========

Storm surge is the additional water level generated by a storm (e.g., tropical cyclone) that exceeds the predicted astronomical tide. To calculate storm surges, wind stress is applied at the water surface:

.. math:: {\bf R}_w = \frac{\rho_a}{\rho} C_{dw} |{\bf U}_{10}| ({\bf U}_{10})

Note that :math:`\bf C` is not used, compared to Eq. :eq:`wind-effects`. 

============
Meteotsunami
============

Meteotsunamis are modeled using a pressure source with a two-dimensional Gaussian distribution:

.. math:: P = dP exp \left(-(\frac{(x^\prime - x_0)^2}{2\sigma_x^2} + \frac{(y^\prime - y_0)^2}{2\sigma_y^2}) \right)

where :math:`dP` is the pressure anomaly in mb, and :math:`(x^\prime,y^\prime)` are the coordinates rotated to the pressure moving direction (angle is :math:`\theta` as indicated in the figure below). :math:`\sigma_x` and :math:`\sigma_y` are paramters representing the length and width of the pressure source, respectively.

**Landslide-generated tsunami**

Landslide-generated tsunamis can be calculated using the same approach as the meteotsunami. Details are reported by `Woodruff et al. (2018) <https://journals.tdl.org/icce/index.php/icce/article/view/8470>`_.
