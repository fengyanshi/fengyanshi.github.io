Wave-Structure Interactions
***************************

.. **UNDER CONSTRUCTION**

Ongoing work with the U.S. Army Engineer Research and Development Center has focused on connecting traditional coastal engineering practices with high-fidelity numerical modeling for the benefit of providing rapid screening of coastal structure alternatives in the planning, engineering, and design phase of a new or existing project. Wave-structure interaction and general wave-driven processes are very complex and can occur across multiple temporal and spatial scales. With FUNWAVE-TVD, the interaction of nearshore wave processes (e.g., runup, overtopping, reflection and diffraction) with a submerged or emergent coastal feature can be assessed quickly and efficiently.

For those interested in coastal engineering applications, this page provides an overview of the nomenclature and reference materials for assessing the performance of **rubble-mound** breakwaters. Detailed guidance and information on these structures, as well as other structure types, are best represented by the `Coastal Engineering Manual (2001) <https://www.publications.usace.army.mil/USACE-Publications/Engineer-Manuals/u43544q/636F617374616C20656E67696E656572696E67206D616E75616C/>`_ and `EurOtop manual (2018) <http://www.overtopping-manual.com/>`_, among others.
