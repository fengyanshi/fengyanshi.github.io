Workshop 2024
==============

We are pleased to share the information about the FUNWAVE-TVD 2024 Training Workshop held on July 23-25, 2024, at the University of Delaware, Newark, DE.  This workshop is organized by the Center for Applied Coastal Research (CACR), University of Delaware, and the US Army Engineer Research and Development Center (ERDC). The workshop is open to all FUNWAVE users and interested parties.

This workshop covered general topics, including the modeling of nearshore surface waves and processes such as harbor resonance, nearshore wave transformation, refraction and diffraction with complex geometries, non-coherent internal wavemaker, nearshore circulation, and tsunami propagation and inundation from ocean basin- to nearshore-scales. It also introduced some new features added to the model recently, such as varying water level boundary condition in a tide/surge module, sub-gridding, and bubble/foam. The three-day workshop included hands-on training sessions for new users, as well as technical talks from the community of practice and experienced users.
