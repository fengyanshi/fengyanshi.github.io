To simulate rainfall effects, especially in modeling compound flooding, the percipitation rate is added in the mass conservation equation

.. math:: \frac{\partial H}{\partial t} + \frac{\partial Hu}{\partial x} = R_p  

where :math:`R_p` represents the precipitation rate. The unit for :math:`R_p` is mm/hour. It is converted to m/s in the equation.
