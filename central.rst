Central Module
*******************

The central module solves the Boussinesq equations and also takes care basic functions such as wavemaker, wave breaking, spongelayers, boundary conditions and model input and output.

Boundary Conditions
===================

  **Wall boundary condition**
     A mirror boundary condition is used for a fully reflective wall.

  **Periodic boundary condition**
     The periodic boundary condition in *y* (south/north) direction was implemented in the code.
