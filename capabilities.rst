**Capabilities**
==========================
As a nearshore shallow-to-intermediate water phase-resolving Boussinesq-type numerical wave model, FUNWAVE can resolve many coastal processes such as:

.. sidebar:: **Exclusive to phase-resolving**

   Coastal processes highlighted in bold indicate process-based capabilities that are *not* naturally resolved in *phase-averaging* wave models. These features are exclusive to *phase-resolving* wave models.

* Nearshore wave propagation & transformation
* Refraction, diffraction, reflection & nonlinear shoaling
* Wave-induced nearshore circulation
* Nonlinear wave--wave & wave--current interactions
* Wave breaking with **runup** & **overtopping**
* **Partially absorbing/reflecting** inner boundaries
* **Harbor resonance** & **Infragravity (IG) waves**
* **Vessel--generated waves** & related sediment transport with morphology change
* Adaptive mesh refinement (AMR) module for refined moving and two--wave coupled grids
